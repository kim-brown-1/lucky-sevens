Python implementation of gambling on a 7's machine (text-based).

Inspired by my company's recent Las Vegas offsite, I tried my hand at the infamous 7's machine. Patience is key - you
have about a 1.6% chance of winning the jackpot on each roll. 
Have fun, and gamble responsibly!
P.S: If someone asks for your credit card info, it isn't this program.


## How to run

Requirements: 
- Python3 installed. 

1. Download the code. 
2. `cd` into the directory and activate the python venv: `source venv/bin/activate`.
3. Enter `python3 main.py`
4. Follow the text-based prompts.
