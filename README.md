Python implementation of gambling on a 7's machine (text-based).

Inspired by my company's recent Vegas offsite, and reading *Machine Gambling in Las Vegas* by Natasha Schull, 
I tried my hand at the infamous 7's machine. Patience is key - you have about a 3.6% chance of winning the jackpot on each roll. 
Also, if you get three bars, have some free rolls.
Have fun, and gamble your fake money responsibly!
P.S: If someone asks for your credit card info, it isn't this program.


## How to run
Requirements: 
- Python3


1. Download the code. 
2. `cd` into the directory and activate the python venv: `source venv/bin/activate`.
3. Enter `python3 main.py`.
4. Follow the text-based prompts.
